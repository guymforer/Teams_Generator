# Teams_Generator
Generate equal teams (by level)

The idea for the app was born from the fact that every time my friends and I had to divide into teams (in soccer games, FIFA, etc.) we would argue and disagree on the division created because it is not equal, therefore, I created this app to save us time and divide the teams as equally as possible.

The application works like this - all the participants who registered for the game will rate the other participants (via Google Forms), the results of the survey will be automatically transferred to google sheets created in advance, where the rating of each participant will be calculated - according to the average of the ratings he received). 
After all the participants have finished ranking, the application connected to the Sheet will divide the groups (according to the Input of the number of groups).# Teams_Generator
